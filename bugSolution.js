The solution involves several strategies to try and resolve the inconsistent rendering behavior. First, ensure that the camera component is mounted within a container that has appropriate dimensions. Sometimes, a zero-sized container can prevent the preview from rendering. Second, verify that the aspect ratio of the camera preview is set correctly to match the dimensions of the container. Mismatched aspect ratios can lead to rendering issues. Third, try explicitly setting the camera type (front or back) if you haven't already. Lastly, consider whether any other elements on the screen might be interfering with the camera preview, potentially due to z-index conflicts. If the problem persists after implementing these checks, ensure that no other components are unintentionally interfering with the camera view, try using a simpler component structure initially to isolate the problem, and lastly, carefully review the Expo Camera API documentation for any potential updates or relevant information.  Consider testing on different devices and simulators. 
```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { Camera, CameraType } from 'expo-camera';

export default function App() {
  const [hasPermission, setHasPermission] = React.useState(null);
  const [type, setType] = React.useState(CameraType.back);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
      setHasPermission(status === 'granted');
    })();
  }, []);

  if (hasPermission === null) {
    return <View/>;
  }
  if (hasPermission === false) {
    return <Text>No access to camera</Text>;
  }
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} type={type}>
      </Camera>
    </View>
  );
}
```
