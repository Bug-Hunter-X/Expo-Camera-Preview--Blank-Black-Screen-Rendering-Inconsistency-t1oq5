This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with a custom camera component.  The problem is that the camera preview doesn't render correctly, displaying a blank screen or a black rectangle, despite the camera being successfully initialized and permissions granted.  This is inconsistent and only happens under certain conditions, making it difficult to debug. The issue is not related to any permissions errors as they are handled correctly. The code correctly initializes the camera and sets the preview style.  No relevant errors are logged to the console.
