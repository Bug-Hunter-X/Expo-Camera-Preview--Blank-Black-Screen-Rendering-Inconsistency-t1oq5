## Expo Camera Preview Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a seemingly random bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API. The camera initializes successfully, permissions are granted, yet the preview consistently displays a blank or black screen.  This issue is intermittent and lacks clear error messages, making it a challenging problem to diagnose and reproduce reliably.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` contains a potential solution (though not guaranteed to work universally).
